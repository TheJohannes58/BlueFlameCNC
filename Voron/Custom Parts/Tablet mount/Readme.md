# Voron 2.1 Tablet Mount

### Overview

This is a two piece mount that allows for a tablet to be mounted where the LCD module typically goes.  

The official "mount_base" and "swing_arm" pieces of the Voron 2.1 are used to hold the base.  The mount is 
double side taped to the table.  Eight 8x3mm magnets are used to hold the mount to the base.
