MEANWELL LRS-150 series is a 150W single-output enclosed type power supply with 30mm of low profile design.  
Adopting the input of 115VAC or 230VAC(selectable by switch), the entire series provides an output voltage line of 12V, 15V, 24V, 36V and 48V. In addition to the high efficiency up to 90%, the design of metallic mesh case enhances the heat dissipation of LRS-150 that the whole series operates from -30℃ through 70℃ under air convection without a fan. Delivering an extremely low no load power consumption (less than 0.5W), it allows the end system to easily meet the worldwide energy requirement.  
LRS-150 has the complete protection functions and 5G anti-vibration capability; it is complied with the international safety regulations such as TUV BS EN / EN62368-1, BS EN / EN60335-1,BS EN / EN61558-1/-2-16, UL62368-1 and GB4943. LRS-150 series serves as a high price-to-performance power supply solution for various industrial applications.
