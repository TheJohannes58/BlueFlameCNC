## Silicone Cable  
What is silicone cable used for?  
The mineral nature of silicone rubber insulation makes the silicone cables uniquely suitable for fire resistant cables required to maintain circuit integrity in the event of a fire. When the cable is in a fire situation a film of fused silica is deposited onto the conductor providing substantial insulation properties.
