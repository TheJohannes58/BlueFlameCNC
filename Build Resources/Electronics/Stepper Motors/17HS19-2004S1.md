This is an updated version nema 17 stepper motor with holding torque of 59Ncm(83.55oz.in) . Based on old verstion, we have lengthened motor cable length to 1 metre, and add a 4-pin 0.1" pitch(2.54mm) Harwin female connector at the end of cable. It's good ideal for 3D printers, as well as CNC and robotics applications.
